### 012 coded vcf file (11,159 loci; 494 individuals)

Broken down by country: 

294 Brazil

144 Costa Rica

56 Panama

### The original PCA which included all 494 individuals, including *P. tuberculatum* :

### Remove *P. tuberculatum* and rerun PCA :

What strikes me is that after removing *P. tuberculatum*, the PA and CR individuals that were originally associated with BR individuals [Accessions #'s 4731 (CR), 4746 (CR), and 1039 (PA)] are now distinguished from them in PC space. This makes sense given that Eric noted that the typical BR morphology was distinct from that found in PA and CR. 

### Looking at Brazil populations separately:

This is kind of a mess, but there is still so much structure even when looking at just BR. It's crazy. 

#### Are any of these patterns cause by missing data?

It doesn't look like these patterns are due to differences in missingness.
