### The original PCA which included all 494 individuals, including *P. tuberculatum* :

### Remove *P. tuberculatum* and rerun PCA :

What strikes me is that after removing *P. tuberculatum*, the PA and CR individuals that were originally associated with BR individuals [Accessions #'s 4731 (CR), 4746 (CR), and 1039 (PA)] are now distinguished from them in PC space. This makes sense given that Eric noted that the typical BR morphology was distinct from that found in PA and CR.
