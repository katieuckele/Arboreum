## Preliminary PCAs  
### 012 coded vcf file (11,159 loci; 494 individuals)

Broken down by country: 

294 Brazil

144 Costa Rica

56 Panama

### The original PCA which included all 494 individuals, including *P. tuberculatum* :

### Remove *P. tuberculatum* and rerun PCA : 

![PCA_prelim_arboreumNoPT_groups](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30299787/103464652-4f371400-4cea-11eb-9511-511bc0676804.jpg)

What strikes me is that after removing *P. tuberculatum*, the PA and CR individuals that were originally associated with BR individuals [Accessions #'s 4731 (CR), 4746 (CR), and 1039 (PA)] are now distinguished from them in PC space. This makes sense given that Eric noted that the typical BR morphology was distinct from that found in PA and CR. 

### PCA of Group 1:

Though the Costa Rican individuals cluster together and are distinct from Panamanian individuals, these clusters do not look super different from one another. 

### PCA of Group 2:

Unlike Group 1, the Costa Rican population (green) looks distinct from the Panamanian population (yellow). 

### PCA of Group 3 (the Costa Rican endemic variety):

### PCA of Group 4 (the Brazilian populations):

The diverged populations on the right hand of the plot were collected from the eastern coast (see map). The majority of our populations were collected from Bras√≠lia. Scroll down to the bottom for this same PCA but with points colored according to percent missingness. 

#### Plot each population on its own:

### What happens when we remove those most diverged populations on the right?

To me, this looks like evidence for a lack of geographic population genetic structure.

#### Finally, are any of these patterns cause by missing data? 

![PCA_prelim_BrazilNoPT_missingness](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30299787/103432799-d1182780-4b9a-11eb-9ebf-ff6710be97ba.jpg)

It doesn't look like these patterns are due to differences in missingness.
